# Binary Search of Sorted Array

his challenge is written with a function that takes a sorted list and a value as arguments and returns the index of the element that equals to the input value, it returns -1 if there is no element equal to this value, it uses binary search method to access this index

## Approach & Efficiency

- I used the binary search method to get the least number steps to find the index, i tested the edge cases and drew a visual to understand the idea, I wrote an algorithm that would match the code. I checked the big O of n and tried to approach methods that would take the least possible time and memory
- big O of n for time // O(n) -> Linear
  big O of n for space // O(n) -> linear
