# Trees

Trees are non-linear data structures, a tree whose elements have at most 2 children is called a binary tree.

## Challenge
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node. And create a Binary Tree class

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in each of your trees -->
